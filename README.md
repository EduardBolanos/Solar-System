# Project Proposal

## The Project:
- A Solar System

## A minimal breakdown of the project innto the largest tasks:
- Create shaders for:
   -  Planet objects
   -  Pluto object
   -  Moon objects
- Create Shadow Mapping
- Create and texture corresponding models in blender
   -  Planets
   -  Moons
- Find and integrate a skybox
- Create HTML and demo for all the pieces to be displayed

## Description of the camera movement:
- User-controlled
  - Why? Because it would much more engaging to have the user move around the space and see everything up close or up the skybox limit
  - The user will most likely use the WASD for movement, arrow keys for looking direction (i.e. up and down looking up and down, left and right for looking left and right) and QE for rotation/local

## One or two things we planned to make our project stand out:
- Shadow Mapping
  - Why? Well if we have planets we need to cast some shadows on certain sides of the planet, even the moons
  
## A topic or two that we needed to research in order to complete our project:
- Shadow mapping
- Planetary orbit
- Moon orbits
